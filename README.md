# yaDM (public repo)
 yaDM (Yet-Another-oh shit something fell on my keyboarD-Manager)

## Why is this?
this is the public repo for a side project I'm doing for uni so my group doesn't have to deal with my not doing web stuff for ages. (tho I'm currently still asking for permission)

why is this so primitive? well, cuz I need to learn basics again and were not supposed to use frameworks.

why is the documentation so bad? the usual case of me having no idea about how to write documentation.

Jenni, this code is horrible what gives? again, me doing the bare minimum of thinking since this is a side project and I haven't actually coded in a while lol.

## What is this?
yaDM is a webapp (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MariaDB in the back-end) for system management, reporting and so on. (no idea about specific features currently)
there will also be a desktop client that reports stats to the database (presumably written in Java but still tbd).
At this point in time I'm not sure if I'll be actually continuing this project or in what time frame it will happen.
